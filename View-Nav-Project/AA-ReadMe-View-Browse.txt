Project Title:          Project-TTD-Website-Rock-Buster-Page
                        ( This a View Browse refinement )

Project Location:       Local: C:\xampp\htdocs\Project-TTD-Website-Rock-Buster-LAMP\rb-page-Exp7

Project Objective:      To document the theory of operation and refine the now 
                        successful < View Browser > concept for the RockBuster 
                        Page developed in folder < rb-page-Exp6 > and to prepare
                        the code to become a basic framework for all TTD 
                        products and beyond!

Project Catalyst:       Have successfully demonstrated my view browsing concept
                        in this project < Project-TTD-Website-Rock-Buster-Page >
                        in this folder < rb-page-Exp6 >. Now will take this
                        and clean it up in this version and also write a 
                        theory of operation in this read me file all as part
                        of < Project-TTD-Website-Rock-Buster-LAMP\rb-page-Exp7 >.

    It's getting time to write a theory of operation for my < View Browser >
    concept. What I've experienced so far is a massive increase in
    navigational speed with NO Scrolling!

    Have been tweaking and improving the code but haven't started writing the
    theory of operation yet.

    The basic objective is to speed up navigation of websites with certain 
    applicable layouts. The suspect websites have layouts that require a lot of
    scrolling. Excessive scrolling reduces the speed of information access,
    disorientation of one's whereabouts, and a less than stellar user 
    experience. 
    Typically, news and shopping websites require excessive scrolling 
    to access news or product information. This is called "Scroll Browsing."
    "View Browsing" breaks up a large scroll column into individual views
    that are accessed via "Hyper Scroll" menus. Hyper Scroll menus are 
    small footprint menus that are clicked or moused to render a set of 
    thumbnail views. This is akin to a news headline or product name with 
    rudimentary information. The thumbnail view can include 
    thumbnail size images or larger ones depending on the setting. 
    A visible thumbnail may then be clicked to render the primary or 
    master view of the selected news 
    item or product detail. The primary views are HTML templates.
